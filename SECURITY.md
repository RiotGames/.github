# Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe that you’ve found a vulnerability,
please report it in [our Bug Bounty program on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/riot).
Please note that only submissions that show an actual impact of exploitation will be rewarded.
Issues reported by security scanners and vulnerabilities in dependencies won’t be eligible for a bounty without demonstrating an actual impact.
